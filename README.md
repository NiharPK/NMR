# NMR
You will need Jupyter Notebook (and of course the required python libraries) to run the codes ending with .ipynb extensions

Basic and advanced NMR experiments to understand and study biomolecular dynamics
NMR spectrum of a system under chemical exchange: play around with the parameters and have some fun learning NMR
Simulate some data of advanced experiments (CEST, CPMG classes), the references for corresponding experiments are included in the respective codes
Play around with the input parameters to see how the input parameters affect the shape of CEST and CPMG profiles
